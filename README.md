# Python Codes: Machine Learning and Computer Vision

Codes in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision

<b> Welcome to my GitHub repo. </b>

I am a Data Scientist and I code in Python. Here you will find some Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision models I developed.

Data for models available at:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0RLknmL54khU2UwX3dnX1E1WHc?usp=sharing  
 
Keras version used in models: keras==2.0.8
Tensorflow version used in models: keras==1.3.0

<b> COCO Model </b>

COCO (Common Objects in Context) is an image segmentation model. This folder presents my Pull Request regarding pycocotools library incompatibility between Python 2 and 3 suggesting a fix.  

<b> CPU Temperature - IoT Project </b>  

In this project I turned my notebook into an IoT device, where CPU temperature is collected via Linux command line run inside a Python notebook and then sent via MQTT protocol to Amazon AWS IoT service, integrated with DynamoDB, Data Pipeline, S3, Quick Sight and Cloud Watch.  

<b> CycleGAN Project </b> -  GANs <br/>

In this folder I presente the steps to train a CycleGAN for Style Transfer applied to paintings of Vincent van Gogh and Pablo Picasso using an EC2 GPU Tesla K-80. Examples of outputs are presented.  

<b> DEEP LEARNING SUMMER SCHOOL </b> -  GANs <br/>

In this folder you will find Tensorflow and Keras codes and also a Powerpoint presentation about GANs I developed for my lecture and workshop at the first Deep Learning Summer School in Brazil, at Goi√°s.  

<b> EC2 INSTANCE SETUP </b>

A set up Manual I developed to create EC2 instances in Amazon AWS  

<b> KERAS </b>
 
GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks
 
DCGANs: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks  
 
<b> OPENCV </b>
 
In this folder you will find a guide to create your own haarcascade.xml so that you can identify any object using OpenCV.  
 
<b> Raspberry Pi3 - IoT Project</b>  

<b> | Not ready yet | </b> In this project I will use Raspberry Pi3 and attach a sensor and then send telemetry data to Amazon AWS IoT service, integrated with DynamoDB, S3, Quick Sight and Cloud Watch. I also plan to deploy a Deep Learning trained model into the device for classification purposes.  

<b> TENSORFLOW </b> 
 
Model for Regression
 
Model for Classification 
 
LSTM: Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks
 
GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks
 
DCGANs: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
 
InfoGANs </b> Mutual Information Adversarial Networks where loss function is customized. 
Mutual Info = H(B)-Sum(P(B=b).H(A|B=b)

Tensorboard: visualization of Tensorflow models' training  
 
 
<b> SEG-NET </b> : Image Segmentation with SEG-NET  
 
<b> SMOTE </b> : Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for imbalanced classes  

<b> YOLO Model </b>

The YOLO Model (You Only Look Once) is a Deep Learning project for Real-Time object detection. Examples of outputs are presented.
